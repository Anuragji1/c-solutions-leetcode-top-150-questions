**Palindrome Number**

Problem Statement 123) Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION = bool isPalindrome(int x){
long int rev = 0;
int temp = x;
if(x<0)
	return false;

while(x){
    rev = rev * 10 + x % 10;
    x /= 10;
	}
        
return (temp == rev);
}

---------Explanation :- 
  Steps:

Handling Negative Numbers:

The code first checks if x is negative. Since palindromes are not defined for negative numbers, it returns false in this case.
Reversing the Digits:

It declares two variables:
rev (of type long int) to store the reversed integer.
temp (of type int) to store a copy of the original input x. This is done because the original value of x will be modified during the reversal process.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as x is not zero. This ensures that all digits of x are processed.
In each iteration:
Isolating the Last Digit: It performs a modulo operation (x % 10) to extract the last (least significant) digit of x.
Building the Reversed Number: It multiplies the current rev by 10 to create space for the new digit at the leftmost position. Then, it adds the extracted last digit (x % 10) to rev. This effectively builds the reversed representation of x digit by digit.
Removing the Last Digit from Original Number: It performs an integer division (x /= 10) to remove the processed last digit from x for the next iteration.
Palindrome Check:

After the loop completes, rev holds the reversed integer.
The code compares the original number (temp) with the reversed number (rev). If they are equal, it means x is a palindrome, and the function returns true.
Overall:

This code effectively reverses the digits of an integer and compares it with the original number to determine if it's a palindrome. It handles negative numbers appropriately and uses clear variable names to improve readability.

Potential Improvements:

Integer Overflow: While long int is used for rev, there could be potential integer overflow issues for very large palindromes. Consider using a larger data type or a more robust approach to handle overflow if dealing with a broader range of integers.
Edge Case Handling: The code doesn't explicitly handle the case where x is a single-digit integer. If such cases are relevant, you might want to add a check for this scenario.
